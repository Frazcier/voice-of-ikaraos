                    <p>
                        A hunter raced up the mountain to stop a forest fire from reaching his kamote field. He heard a voice and found a large snake,
                        burned and in pain. The snake said "Bury me. From now on, so snakes won't bite you, wear a leg band below the knee (string, wire, rattan).
                        When snakes see the band, they won't bite." Men wore the bands; if a Karao was bitten, saying "I am Karao" and elders' prayers are said to
                        reduce swelling. That's why snakes do not bite the Karao.

                            <p>He went to hunt on the mountain. When he had nearly reached the top, there was a forest fire. The mountain was burning. He ran anxiously to his kamote field so he could put out the fire. As he was running, he heard a voice. When he looked back, he saw a big snake that had been burned and was writhing in pain.</p>
                            <p>‚ÄúBury me,‚Äù said the snake. ‚ÄúI will die soon. Look, the fire got me.‚Äù The man was very surprised.</p>
                            <p>The snake said, ‚ÄúFrom now on, so that snakes will not bite you, you wear leg bands. Tie the band below your knee‚Äîstring, wire, rattan, or cloth. That is what the snakes will see; when they see the band, they will not bite. And if a snake accidentally bites you, say, ‚ÄòI am a Karao,‚Äô so you will not die from the bite.‚Äù</p>
                            <p>Leg bands were worn only by men. The band was tied so no ends were left hanging.</p>
                            <p>After that the snake, said to be king of the snakes, died, and the hunter buried it. He told the story to the elders. From that time, people in Karao wore leg bands so snakes would not bite them. If a Karao person is accidentally bitten, the swelling does not continue‚Äîespecially if they say, ‚ÄúYou accidentally bit me; I am Karao.‚Äù If a non‚ÄëKarao is bitten here, Karao people pray for him saying, ‚ÄúThis one you bit is a Karao; you bit him,‚Äù and the swelling goes down. That is why snakes do not bite the Karao.</p>

And the turtle said, "All right, yes, let's divide it." They got a bush knife, they cut it, and they divided the banana tree in two. The turtle said to the monkey, "This is yours, the part that has leaves is what you will plant. This is mine, the part with the base is what I will plant." Then they parted, and they planted the banana trees.</p>
                            <p>After a little while, the monkey, he wen to the turtle. He said, "Something's wrong with that banana tree that you gave to me; it did not live. It died. And here is yours, it has produced fruit."</p>
                            <p>After that, the turtle said, "Maybe you didn't take good care of it. That's why it died. Maybe you didn't keep watering it."</p>
                            <p>"No, it was already dead. So you give me some of the fruit of your banana tree." And then the turtle said, "Yes, because anyway I can't climb. Go ahead and climb up, and you drop lots of fruit to me. Then the monkey climbed up. When he had gone to the top of the banana tree, he started to eat some of the ripe bananas, but he did not give the turtle any. The turtle said, "Give me some too. Drop some bananas to me." Instead, the monkey laughed and laughed, "That's what you get. Why was it the shoot of the banana tree that you gave to me? It died and I have nothing. Now I will eat this fruit of the banana tree. You tricked me."</p>
                            <p>Then the turtle thought, "Damn this monkey!" After that, the turtle got some thorns of the bamboo plant. He inserted them around the base of the banana tree. And then he hid himself; he covered himself with a coconut shell. After that, the monkey was full. He came down. When he stepped on the ground, he was pierced. The thorns of the bamboo plant that Turtle had inserted pierced him. Then Monkey was in great pain. "Where is that turtle? I'll kill him." He searched and searched, but he didn't find him. And then after that, he sat down on the coconut shell where the turtle was hiding, and he removed the thorns that had been used to pierce his body. After that, Monkey stood up. He said, "Here's a beautiful coconut shell. I'll take it." When he took the coconut shell, there was Turtle.</p>
                            <p>"So here you are. I'm going to kill you. Why did you pierce me? My feet were really hurt." Then he took Turtle and he said,</p>
                            <p>"Now I will pound you." Turtle said, "Thank you if you will pound me. If you pound me, I will become lots."</p>
                            <p>"No then, I will burn you."</p>
                            <p>Monkey got some fire.</p>
                            <p>"Ah, I will burn you."</p>
                            <p>Turtle said, "Thank you if you will burn me so that I will become red and beautiful."</p>
                            <p>Then Monkey said, "Damn, what shall I do with this turtle? Ah, I'll throw you in te water."</p>
                            <p>Turtle said, "Please, please, don't throw me in the water. I'll be swept away." But he was thinking it would be fortunate if he were thrown in the water because the water was his home. Then Monkey said, "Too bad for you, I'm going to throw you in the water in the river so that you will be swept away." Then Monkey got Turtle. He threw him in the river. Then when he was in the water, Turtle, laughed, "Ha, ha, ha, ha. Monkey, don't you know that this water is my home? You come after me."</p>
                            <p>Monkey got mad, he jumped into the water, and he though that he could go after Turtle, but he didn't know how to swim, and so he was swept away. Then Turtle laughed and laughed. Then he went back to where his banana tree was, and he himself was the one who eat and eat those bananas.</p>

                            <p>Pagit, he was a rich person in Trinidad.</p>
                            <p>His wife, she was a woman who came from Bokod. </p>
                            <p>They were childless.</p>
                            <p>They had no children.</p>
                            <p>During the time when the Japanese controlled the Philippines, they lived in Bokod because life in Trinidad was hard then. But in the year 1945, the American soldiers arrived to liberate the Philippines. And then when the Japanese realized that they would be defeated, they killed without cause.</p>
                            <p>They killed any civilians that they happened to meet.</p>
                            <p>So all the civilians, they fled.</p>
                            <p>And this married couple, Pagit and Marina, they fled to Kadasan.</p>
                            <p>They stayed there three months.</p>
                            <p>Then one day when he had gone to look for something that they would eat, the Japanese soldiers captured him.</p>
                            <p>They got him, and they took him to their camp.</p>
                            <p>They kept interrogating him and mistreating him because they wanted him to tell where the guerrillas were.</p>
                            <p>They never fed him, and he was very hungry.</p>
                            <p>Then one night when the Japanese were sleeping, Pagit untied the bonds on his legs, and he ran away.</p>
                            <p>He walked and walked in the mountains because he did not know where he was. </p>
                            <p>On the third day, a person from Kadasan whose name was Salawad happened to come upon him. </p>
                            <p>He tied him up, and he took him to their evacuation site. </p>
                            <p>His companions who were from Kadasan said, ‚ÄúHe is a spy for the Japanese.  We will have to kill him.‚Äù </p>
                            <p>Then they tied him tightly against the trunk of a tree. Then Pagit pleaded with them for mercy. </p>
                            <p>He said, ‚ÄúPlease have pity! Don‚Äôt kill me. I‚Äôm not a spy. The Japanese captured me, and I escaped to here. I know Beray who is from Karao very well. He knows me very well too.  So please have pity. Don‚Äôt kill me.‚Äù </p>
                            <p>When the people from Kadasan heard what he had said, they said, ‚ÄúBeray‚Äôs son, John, was here visiting. We will send someone to follow him so that he will return here. We will ask him if they really know this person.‚Äù They sent Socti to follow me. He caught up with me halfway along the way [to where I was going]. </p>
                            <p>He said, ‚ÄúThere is a person that we have captured. He might be a spy for the Japanese. And we intend to kill him, but he said that he knows Beray well. So let‚Äôs go, please. You will see if you really know him. We tied him to the trunk of a tree.‚Äù Then I returned.</p>
                            <p>When we arrived, I saw that it was really Pagit.</p>
                            <p>I said to Salawad, ‚ÄúThis is Pagit. He fled with us. He is not a spy for the Japanese. You untie his bonds.‚Äù Then Pagit became very happy. He shed lots of tears because he was so happy. Then I took him with me to our evacuation site.  But he was not able to walk. I kept feeding him flowers of the trees and moldy peelings of a kamote that we had found in the corner of a house of the Kadasan people who had fled from it. When the war had finished, Pagit and his companions went to San Fabian, Nueva Vizcaya, to live there. He kept having me called to come so that he could give me a rice field, but I never went.</p>
                            <p>Then Pagit died, and his wife too.</p>
                            <p>I will never forget this that happened to me when I was little when I protected a person‚Äôs life.</p>

                            <p>When I was a little girl, I experienced a hard life because before there was no road, and so the place where the necessities for living always came from, it was Baguio. But they used to walk from here to Baguio, and they would sleep at the halfway point on the trail. Whatever they would buy there, a little salt or a necessity, it would be carried here [by a person]. And then we would continue walking, and we would sleep again at the halfway point on the trail. The next day we would walk to here. It would take two days to walk from Baguio to here. And so life was hard before because there was no transportation. And what was taken as a pack lunch before when we went to Baguio, it was kamote.  It was put in a backpack. And when we reached a stream, we would eat there, and we would scoop the water with our hands and drink it. We would use our hands to scoop the water and drink it. And when we had rested again a little while, we would continue walking until we arrived here. Before too, there was no school here in Karao.</p>
                            <p>The school, it was in Bokod. And the students, they would walk from Karao to Bokod every day. Only a few had the patience to walk back and forth to Bokod. So only a few were educated because there was no school before. It [Bokod] only went up to Grade 6. Grades 1 and 2 were here, but Grades 3 through 6, they were in Bokod. As for high school, there is none here. It [the high school] is only in Bokod [today]. Before it was only in Baguio. Before we children who were not students, our parents would take us along with them to make kamote gardens in the mountains. They would teach us how to carry a kaybang basket. And all the kinds of work done by the adults in the family, the children used to do it before because there was no school for the children to go to so they [the parents] taught us the work. There were no jobs before. There was no employment to provide for the needs of their children. The only means of making a living before, it was a little rice field and kamote, the kamote garden. So when the road came, our way of life changed a bit. It is as though it became a little bit easier.</p>

                        During rice harvest, people first eat a small meal (malmal). The owner‚Äôs share (aweto or chikel‚Äîbundles with the biggest grains) is prepared. Harvesters avoid setting down their kaybang baskets until the bundler of the owner‚Äôs

                            <p>Long ago, when we harvested rice, it was necessary that we eat just a little meal which they called malmal. And when the little meal was finished, the one who bundles the owner‚Äôs share of the rice which they call aweto would start [to harvest]. And we would all carry our kaybang baskets. And when it was almost noon, you would set down your basket only after the one who is bundling the owner‚Äôs share of the rice first set down her basket so that the harvest would not be reduced.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of eating only a small meal, or malmal, is to leave some food for the spirits to eat, thereby gaining their favor and ensuring a plentiful harvest.</p>
                            <p>The aweto (literally ‚Äòits father‚Äô), or chikel, are bundles of rice stalks having the largest grains. These bundles belong to the owner of the field. Bundles of rice stalks having smaller grains are called anakto (literally ‚Äòits child‚Äô), or sool, and belong to those who are harvesting as their payment for both.</p>

                            <p>These are the stories about the Karaos not eating the meat of dogs, the meat of horses, and hot peppers. The stories differ from each other, but these are the common ones. The dog, people always keep it as a companion. It guards the house. It goes with its master wherever he goes. If its master stays overnight somewhere, it will sleep with him. It will not leave him. If its masters go to work in the fields, it will always go along with them. It will always guard them. A hunter takes it along when he goes hunting. The dog never forgets its master. Even if you are away somewhere a long, long time, it will never forget you. A dog is trained, and it is given a name like a person. It will warn you when something really frightening is going to happen. That‚Äôs why people, they shut the dog up in the house, especially when it is the time of a strong storm. If the dog takes a piece of partially burnt firewood in its mouth and wants to go out, we have to go outside because a flood is coming or a landslide that will cover the house. If an old man or an old woman dies, they have him accompanied by his dog so that he [the person] will always take it along where he is going. But the owner of the house will not eat the dog, even the old people. It is only the young men, but just a few still do it.</p>
                            <p>The horse, it is another friend of people. When they travel to a far place, they ride on a horse. Even if they are drunk, even if it is very dark, the horse will take them to their house. They have the horse carry heavy cargo. The horse, it is trained like a dog. If you tell it to run, it will run. If you tell it to stop, it will stop. The horse is the friend of people. It is like a dog. The horse has many uses: for riding, for pulling a cart, for racing, and for carrying heavy cargo. That‚Äôs why the people in Karao, they do not eat the meat of horses. It is like the dog. If an old man dies, they have him accompanied by a horse as something for him to ride wherever he goes. For this reason, there are many Karaos who do not eat the meat of horses, especially the old men and women. </p>
                            <p>Hot peppers, it is forbidden to use them in the indothoan ritual, the sindad ritual, and other chilos rituals in which a pig is used. They say that the spirits will get angry if the meat of the pig or the chicken has hot peppers added to it or it is dipped in a sauce made of hot peppers. If it is the meat of a water buffalo, we can add hot peppers to it, but it must be outside the house, not inside. But now, the custom is changing. Now we can add hot peppers to the meat inside the house, as long as we do not call it sili. We call it bithoka so that the spirits will not know. The spirits can be tricked. That‚Äôs why now the Karaos eat hot peppers.</p>
