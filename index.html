                    <p>
                        A hunter raced up the mountain to stop a forest fire from reaching his kamote field. He heard a voice and found a large snake,
                        burned and in pain. The snake said "Bury me. From now on, so snakes won't bite you, wear a leg band below the knee (string, wire, rattan).
                        When snakes see the band, they won't bite." Men wore the bands; if a Karao was bitten, saying "I am Karao" and elders' prayers are said to
                        reduce swelling. That's why snakes do not bite the Karao.

                            <p>He went to hunt on the mountain. When he had nearly reached the top, there was a forest fire. The mountain was burning. He ran anxiously to his kamote field so he could put out the fire. As he was running, he heard a voice. When he looked back, he saw a big snake that had been burned and was writhing in pain.</p>
                            <p>‚ÄúBury me,‚Äù said the snake. ‚ÄúI will die soon. Look, the fire got me.‚Äù The man was very surprised.</p>
                            <p>The snake said, ‚ÄúFrom now on, so that snakes will not bite you, you wear leg bands. Tie the band below your knee‚Äîstring, wire, rattan, or cloth. That is what the snakes will see; when they see the band, they will not bite. And if a snake accidentally bites you, say, ‚ÄòI am a Karao,‚Äô so you will not die from the bite.‚Äù</p>
                            <p>Leg bands were worn only by men. The band was tied so no ends were left hanging.</p>
                            <p>After that the snake, said to be king of the snakes, died, and the hunter buried it. He told the story to the elders. From that time, people in Karao wore leg bands so snakes would not bite them. If a Karao person is accidentally bitten, the swelling does not continue‚Äîespecially if they say, ‚ÄúYou accidentally bit me; I am Karao.‚Äù If a non‚ÄëKarao is bitten here, Karao people pray for him saying, ‚ÄúThis one you bit is a Karao; you bit him,‚Äù and the swelling goes down. That is why snakes do not bite the Karao.</p>

                            <p>There is a story about the monkey and the turtle. They were friends. When the turtle found a banana tree, the monkey said, "Let's divide it." And the turtle said, "All right, yes, let's divide it." They got a bush knife, they cut it, and they divided the banana tree in two. The turtle said to the monkey, "This is yours, the part that has leaves is what you will plant. This is mine, the part with the base is what I will plant." Then they parted, and they planted the banana trees.</p>
                            <p>After a little while, the monkey, he wen to the turtle. He said, "Something's wrong with that banana tree that you gave to me; it did not live. It died. And here is yours, it has produced fruit."</p>
                            <p>After that, the turtle said, "Maybe you didn't take good care of it. That's why it died. Maybe you didn't keep watering it."</p>
                            <p>"No, it was already dead. So you give me some of the fruit of your banana tree." And then the turtle said, "Yes, because anyway I can't climb. Go ahead and climb up, and you drop lots of fruit to me. Then the monkey climbed up. When he had gone to the top of the banana tree, he started to eat some of the ripe bananas, but he did not give the turtle any. The turtle said, "Give me some too. Drop some bananas to me." Instead, the monkey laughed and laughed, "That's what you get. Why was it the shoot of the banana tree that you gave to me? It died and I have nothing. Now I will eat this fruit of the banana tree. You tricked me."</p>
                            <p>Then the turtle thought, "Damn this monkey!" After that, the turtle got some thorns of the bamboo plant. He inserted them around the base of the banana tree. And then he hid himself; he covered himself with a coconut shell. After that, the monkey was full. He came down. When he stepped on the ground, he was pierced. The thorns of the bamboo plant that Turtle had inserted pierced him. Then Monkey was in great pain. "Where is that turtle? I'll kill him." He searched and searched, but he didn't find him. And then after that, he sat down on the coconut shell where the turtle was hiding, and he removed the thorns that had been used to pierce his body. After that, Monkey stood up. He said, "Here's a beautiful coconut shell. I'll take it." When he took the coconut shell, there was Turtle.</p>
                            <p>"So here you are. I'm going to kill you. Why did you pierce me? My feet were really hurt." Then he took Turtle and he said,</p>
                            <p>"Now I will pound you." Turtle said, "Thank you if you will pound me. If you pound me, I will become lots."</p>
                            <p>"No then, I will burn you."</p>
                            <p>Monkey got some fire.</p>
                            <p>"Ah, I will burn you."</p>
                            <p>Turtle said, "Thank you if you will burn me so that I will become red and beautiful."</p>
                            <p>Then Monkey said, "Damn, what shall I do with this turtle? Ah, I'll throw you in te water."</p>
                            <p>Turtle said, "Please, please, don't throw me in the water. I'll be swept away." But he was thinking it would be fortunate if he were thrown in the water because the water was his home. Then Monkey said, "Too bad for you, I'm going to throw you in the water in the river so that you will be swept away." Then Monkey got Turtle. He threw him in the river. Then when he was in the water, Turtle, laughed, "Ha, ha, ha, ha. Monkey, don't you know that this water is my home? You come after me."</p>
                            <p>Monkey got mad, he jumped into the water, and he though that he could go after Turtle, but he didn't know how to swim, and so he was swept away. Then Turtle laughed and laughed. Then he went back to where his banana tree was, and he himself was the one who eat and eat those bananas.</p>
